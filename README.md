## My process

Premise, sorry for my english!

I started first with the structure for mobile device (mobile first!) and from @media queries I produced the desk's version (with some mistake, I guess)
Unlike the others challenges, I used the Flex Layout, that many users recommended to me to use in the feedback (It's really useful!)of other challenges.

I've uploaded the two images (mobile and desk) on HTML and I've hidden the desk's version(display: none) and I took it in the @media queries (display: block)
I hope I did in the right way, feedback are accepted as well!


I got "tangled up" with paddings and margins, where I made some mistakes, and maybe I could have made the code shorter and less "complex"
At the end of all, I don't think it came out that bad and far away from the original version.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

### Continued development

On the next works I'll focus more on the Flex Layout and its properties. 
Also, I think I need to focus and improve a lot on the @media queries, where I still have many difficulties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) - This helped me for the flexbox layout. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some little advice on any of the topic
